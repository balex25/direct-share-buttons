Direct Social Icons
===================
*Formerly known as Intent Social Icons*

A pure HTML & CSS implementation on allowing your end users to interact with social networks from your site without any need of loading in heavy JavaScript-based widgets.

# Installation 
First download the `direct-social-buttons.css` in this repository and include it at the top of your page with the font awesome CDN link:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="direct-social-buttons.css">
```
(Or where you have saved the `direct-social-buttons.css` file...)

Next view the demo.html page to find suitable social buttons and copy the code and you're done! :)
